----------------------------------

* Welcome to Prompt Engineering for Marketing
---------------------------------------------
Whether you are a marketing professional or just have a product to market, AI models can help you plan and execute an effective marketing strategy.

In this lesson, we’ll explore different ways AI language models like ChatGPT can be used for marketing:

	. developing a digital marketing strategy

	. writing product descriptions and other copy

	. planning a social media campaign

While ChatGPT is a powerful tool for generating content, we’ll also discuss common pitfalls when using AI, including

	. inaccuracies or hallucinations

	. copyright and plagiarism

	. ethical issues like bias

	. formatting and other structural errors

Throughout, we’ll focus on prompt engineering: the art of iteratively designing prompts that will help ChatGPT generate output tailored to your specific marketing tasks.

With effective prompt engineering, you’ll be able to use the best of both human and artificial intelligence to support your brand and products.

Let’s get started!

Throughout the course, we’ll use FakeGPT, a ChatGPT simulator. All sample responses delivered by FakeGPT are actual responses received from ChatGPT, not responses written by us. In 
addition, note that while we are focusing on ChatGPT, the techniques we teach will work with most other large language models, like Google Bard.

We’ve loaded an example of FakeGPT in the learning environment to the right. There are a couple sample prompts at the bottom. Try sending each one and see what FakeGPT returns!
